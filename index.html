          I get too attached to trustin' better halves <br>
          In a flash, we lost all that we had <br>
          I felt guilty every time we'd laugh <br>
          'Cause I couldn't see behind your mask <br>
          Could it be the timin' or the wrong place? <br>
          Gettin' sick of hearin' you say "always" <br>
          Show a little effort and that's all it takes

          <br>
          <br>
          <span>
            How could love feel safe with a seed of doubt? (Oh-oh) <br>
            All the nights I prayed you would be around (Oh-oh)  <br>
            No-oh-oh, oh-oh <br>
            Please don't go-oh-oh, oh-oh <br>
            Said that it was never your fault, who was keeping count? (Oh-oh) <br>
            Guess that I thought it would even out (Oh-oh) <br>
            No-oh-oh, oh-oh <br>
            Now I know-oh-oh <br>
            We'd never last like cheap cologne <br>
            Last like chеap cologne <br>
            Last like cheap colognе <br>
          </span>
          <br>

          Word to my preacher, I'll dig a little deeper <br>
          'Cause sometimes what's real don't always show on the surface <br>
          Don't matter how I treat her, you see it in her demeanor <br>
          Like how we call it love, if we gon' end it all on purpose? (No) <br>
          Could it be the timin' or the wrong place? <br>
          Gettin' sick of hearin' you say "always" <br>
          Show a little effort and that's all it takes <br>

          <br>

            How could love feel safe with a seed of doubt? (Oh-oh) <br>
